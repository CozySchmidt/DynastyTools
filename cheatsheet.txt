Use python environment for django stuff

Getting into environment:
 - venv\Scripts\Activate.bat
 

Open 2 cmd lines.   
    One in evironment at the root of the project (where manage.py is)
    One not in environment in the frontend folder



Starting the server with new changes:
(in \frontend, without venv)
    npm run build

(In venv)
    if changes in models.py:
        python manage.py makemigrations
        python manage.py migrate
    
    python manage.py collectstatic --no-input
    python manage.py runserver



Git:
    commit your changes to your working branch / or discard changes
    checkout develop
    pull
    create new branch 'initial/version_branchname_itemnumber' -> 'LC/0.0.1_create_cheatsheet_37'
    (make ur code changes)
    commit
    push
    (make pull request on github to merge your branch into develop)
